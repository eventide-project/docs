# Entity Projection

An [entity](./entities.md) receives its data from events. Each event may have some piece of data to contribute to the entity's state. Multiple events are typically involved in providing an entity with all of its state.

The entity projection is the mechanism that affects an entity with an event's data. The projection _applies_ the event to the entity.

The entity projection applies one event to one entity. To apply multiple events to an entity, the projection is invoked once for each event in sequence.

When an entity is "retrieved" from the [message store](./message-store), it's the events that are retrieved, and then fed one-by-one in the order that they were written and applied to the entity via a projection.

<div class="note custom-block">
  <p>
    Note: Events should be applied in the same order that they were recorded. This preserves any inherent order of operations of events, and allows the projection to reconstruct the state of the entity correctly.
  </p>
</div>

## Example

``` ruby
class Projection
  include EntityProjection

  entity_name :account

  apply Deposited do |deposited|
    account.id = deposited.account_id

    amount = deposited.amount

    account.deposit(amount)
  end

  apply Withdrawn do |withdrawn|
    account.id = withdrawn.account_id

    amount = withdrawn.amount

    account.withdraw(amount)
  end
end

class Account
  include DataStructure::Schema

  attribute :id, String
  attribute :balance, Numeric, default: 0

  def deposit(amount)
    self.balance += amount
  end

  def withdraw(amount)
    self.balance -= amount
  end
end

account = Account.new

deposited = Deposited.new()
deposited.account_id = '123'
deposited.amount = 11

withdrawn = Withdrawn.new()
withdrawn.account_id = '123'
withdrawn.amount = 1

[deposited, withdrawn].each do |event|
  Projection.(account, event)
end

account.id
# => "123"

account.balance
# => 10
```

## Entity Projection Facts

- Projections mutate an entity's state
- An actuation of a projection applies one event to one entity
- An event is ignored if the projection doesn't have a matching `apply` block for the event
- Events should be applied in the same order that the events were recorded
- Projections do not interact with the message store
- An `apply` block should not have any logic that decides whether an event should be applied or not. An `apply` block should apply the events that it handles, or not handle them at all.

## EntityProjection Module

A class becomes a projection by including the `EntityProjection` module from the [`EntityProjection` library](./libraries.md#entity-projection) and namespace.

The `EntityProjection` module affords the receiver with:

- The `apply` class macro used for defining event application blocks
- The principle instance actuator `.()` (or the `call` instance method) for applying a single event to an entity
- The class actuator `.()` (or the class `call` method) that provides a convenient invocation shortcut that does not require instantiating the projection class first
- Infrastructure for registering events that are projected, and the dispatching logic used to apply events and event data

## Defining a Projection

### Using the apply Macro

A projection block is defined with the `apply` macro.

``` ruby
apply Withdrawn do |withdrawn|
  account.id = withdrawn.account_id
  amount = withdrawn.amount
  account.withdraw(amount)
end
```

The argument is a class name of the event that the apply block will process. The block argument is the instance of the event being projected.

The macro is merely a code generator that generates an instance method. The example above generates an instance method named `apply_withdrawn`. The macro is simply an affordance intended to emphasize the code in a projection class that is directly responsible for event projection. The apply block code is used as the implementation of the generated method.

### Using a Plain Old Method

The `apply` macro generates methods with names of the form `apply_{event_class_name_underscore_case}`.

Projections can be created by directly defining a method following the naming convention.

``` ruby
def apply_withdrawn(withdrawn)
  # ...
end
```

## Accessing the Entity

### Via the entity Accessor

By default, the [entity](./entities.md) that the projection is constructed with can be accessed using the `entity` method.

``` ruby
entity()
```

**Returns**

Instance of the entity that the projection is constructed with.

``` ruby{3}
apply Withdrawn do |withdrawn|
  amount = withdrawn.amount
  entity.withdraw(amount)
end
```

### Via the Named Accessor

An alias for the `entity` accessor is generated by the `entity_name` class macro.

``` ruby{4,8}
class SomeProjection
  include EntityProjection

  entity_name :something

  apply Deposited do |deposited|
    amount = deposited.amount
    something.deposit(amount)
  end
```

## Sending an Event to a Projection

There are two ways to send an event to a projection:

- Via an [entity store](./stores.md)
- Via direct actuation

### Via an Entity Store

An entity store brings event projection and event storage retrieval together in an object that has the feel of a typical data access object.

``` ruby
class Store
  include EntityStore

  category :account
  entity Account
  projection Projection
  reader MessageStore::Postgres::Read
end

store = AccountStore.build
account = store.fetch('123')

account.id
# => "123"

account.balance
# => 10
```

<div class="note custom-block">
  <p>
    Note: See the <a href="/user-guide/stores.html">Entity Store User Guide</a> for more information about entity stores.
  </p>
</div>

### Direct Actuation

A projection can be actuated directly as an object, passing an event as a parameter. Direct actuation is critical for testing and exercising handlers, as it allows handlers to be exercised as plain old objects. It's also a useful technique in some event data analysis scenarios.

Projections can be actuated either via its class interface, as a matter of convenience, or via its instance interface, which allows for greater control of the configuration of the projection.

Projections are implemented as _callable objects_. Actuating them is simply a matter of invoking their `call` method.

``` ruby
some_event = SomeEvent.new

# Via the class interface
SomeProjection.(some_event)

# Via the object interface
some_projectioin = SomeProjection.build
some_projectioin.(some_message)
```

### When a Projection Doesn't Handle a Message

When there isn't a matching `apply` block for a message, the projection simply ignores the event sent to it.

## Matching Events to Apply Blocks

When an event is sent to a projection, the projection determines whether there is an apply method that can receive the message.

An apply method is determined to match an inbound event based on the event's class name and the method's name.

An event class named `SomeEvent` is sent to an apply method named `apply_some_event`.

Only the event's class name is taken into considering when matching a message to a handler method. The class's namespace is not significant to matching. For a message class named `Something::Events::SomeEvent`, only the `SomeEvent` part of the event's class name is significant.

## Projecting Raw Message Data

In addition to handling typed events, projections can apply `MessageData` instances in their raw form.

See the [Message and MessageData](./message-and-message-data.md#message-data) user guide for more on messages and message data.

The raw form of a message is an instance of `MessageStore::MessageData`.

The object that is sent to a projection from an entity store is an instance of `MessageData`. The projection converts the `MessageData` into its corresponding event message instance.

If a projection implements a method named `apply` _and_ if there's no explicit handler block that specifically matches the `MessageData` object's `type` attribute, then the `MessageData` instance will be passed to the `apply` method.

``` ruby
def apply(message_data)
  case message_data.type
  when 'Withdrawn'
    # Project Withdrawn
  when 'Deposited'
    # Project Deposited
  end
end
```

The `apply` method will not be invoked if there's an apply block that matches the `MessageData`'s `type` attribute.

``` ruby
class Handler
  include Messaging::Handle

  apply Withdrawn do |withdrawn|
    # ...
  end

  def apply(message_data)
    case message_data.type
    when 'Withdrawn'
      # This will never be invoked because the apply block
      # for Withdraw takes precedence
    when 'Deposited'
      # This will be called when the type attribute is 'Deposited'
      # because there's no apply block for Deposited
    end
  end
end
```

### When to Apply Raw Message Data

Because the raw `MessageData` is not transformed into typed event messages, projecting `MessageData` in its raw form offers a slight performance improvement due to skipping the transformation step.

That said, the performance improvement is negligible. Don't elect to use this option unless squeezing every last drop of performance out of your solution is critical to its success.

## Apply Blocks Return the Input Message

Apply blocks and the `apply` method return the message that is the input to the handler.

When the input is an instance of `Messaging::MessageData`, and there's a typed apply block that applies the `MessageData`'s type, the instance of typed message that the `MessageData` is converted to will be returned.

When projecting the raw `MessageData` using the `apply` method, the `MessageData` instance is returned.

## Constructing Projections

Projections can be constructed in one of two ways:

- Via the constructor
- Via the initializer

### Via the Constructor

``` ruby
self.build(entity)
```

The constructor not only instantiates the projection, but also invokes the projection's `configure` instance method, which constructs the projection's operational dependencies.

``` ruby
some_projection = SomeProjection.build
```

**Returns**

Instance of the class that includes the `EntityProjection` module.

**Parameters**

| Name | Description | Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| entity | Instance of an object or data structure whose state will be mutated by the projection's apply methods | Object |

### Via the Initializer

``` ruby
self.initialize(entity)
```

**Returns**

Instance of the class that includes the `EntityProjection` module.

**Parameters**

| Name | Description | Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| entity | Instance of an object or data structure whose state will be mutated by the projection's apply methods | Object |

By constructing a handler using the initializer, the handler's dependencies are not set to operational dependencies. They remain _inert substitutes_.

See the [useful objects](./useful-objects.md#substitutes) user guide for background on inert substitutes.
:::

## Configuring Dependencies

``` ruby
configure()
```

If the projection implements an instance method named `configure`, the `build` constructor will invoke it.

The `configure` method provides a specialization mechanism for setting up any dependencies, or doing any setup necessary.

``` ruby
dependency :clock, Clock::UTC

def configure
  Clock::UTC.configure(self)
end
```

## Always Project the Entity ID

It's good practice to always project the entity ID in every apply block. It's possible, due to the vagaries of computers, networks, and electricity that events may not be written, and thus projected, in the order that they are presumed to be written. Certain message transport architectures in more elaborate systems topologies may cause this. This is especially true where intermediaries are involved.

The general rule is that the first event in an event stream should establish an entity's ID. Due to the possibilities that events may be in an order other than the one assumed, any event may be the first event projected.

``` ruby{7,13}
class Projection
  include EntityProjection

  entity_name :account

  apply Deposited do |deposited|
    account.id = deposited.account_id
    amount = deposited.amount
    account.deposit(amount)
  end

  apply Withdrawn do |withdrawn|
    account.id = withdrawn.account_id
    amount = withdrawn.amount
    account.withdraw(amount)
  end
end
```

If this is not done, and under the right circumstances, an entity may be retrieved in a handler that does not yet have an id. In such a case, the value of the ID used in the handler logic will be `nil`. A `nil` entity will cause a number of malfunctions that would be difficult - and in some cases, impossible - to correct.

<div class="note custom-block">
  <p>
    Note: While the circumstances that cause this anomaly are very rare, that rarity should not be counted upon. Projections should be constructed conservatively so that the realities of out-of-order events are never a problem.

## Log Tags

The following tags are applied to log messages recorded by an entity projection:

| Tag | Description |
| --- | --- |
| projection | Applied to all log messages recorded by an entity projection |
| apply | Applied to log messages recorded when applying a typed message or MessageData to an entity |

The following tags _may_ be applied to log messages recorded by an entity projection:

| Tag | Description |
| --- | --- |
| message | Applied to log messages that record the projection of a typed message instance |
| message_data | Applied to log messages that record the projection of a MessageData instance |
| data | Applied to log messages that record the data content of a typed message or a MessageData instance |

See the [logging](/user-guide/logging/) user guide for more on log tags.
